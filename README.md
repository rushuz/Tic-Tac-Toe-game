# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

A simple and interactive Tic-Tac-Toe game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game features smooth flip effects for each move, a confetti celebration for the winner, sound notifications on winning, and a win counter for both players (`X` and `O`).

## Features

- **Player vs Player**: Two players can take turns to play.
- **Flip Effect**: Each box flips when clicked for a dynamic experience.
- **Color Changes**: Boxes change color for `X` and `O` to distinguish between players.
- **Win Condition**: The game checks for a winner after each move.
- **Draw Condition**: If all boxes are filled without a winner, a draw is declared.
- **Celebration**: Confetti is triggered on winning, along with a sound notification.
- **Win Count**: Tracks and displays the number of wins for both players (`X` and `O`).

## How It Works

- **Turn-taking**: Players take turns to click on the empty boxes, one marking `O` and the other `X`.
- **Winner Detection**: The game checks after every move if any player has won by matching three of their marks in a row, column, or diagonal.
- **Draw Detection**: If all boxes are filled and no player has won, it is considered a draw.
- **Reset**: After a win or draw, the reset button allows starting a new game.
